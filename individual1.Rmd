```{r}
library(tidyverse)

choco <- read.csv('choco.csv')
names(choco)
# rows(choco)
```



# What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?


Amount of duplicated rows.

```{r}
nrow(choco[! duplicated(choco), ]) - nrow(choco)
```

```{r}
length(choco$Rating)
```

Because there are no duplicates, we can conclude there are 1852 rated bars.

# Which are the three locations with the most ratings? How do ratings compare across these company locations?

```{r}
AggRatings <- choco %>%
  group_by(Company.Location) %>%
    summarize(AggRatings.Location = n()) %>%
      arrange(desc(AggRatings.Location)) 

MostPopular <- head(AggRatings, 3)

print(MostPopular)

choco %>%
  filter(Company.Location == 'U.S.A.') %>%
    pull(Rating) %>%
      summary()
```
