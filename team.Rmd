```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# 2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
```{r}
choco %>%
  group_by(Review.Date) %>%
  summarize(numRatings = n()) -> choco_ratings

choco_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Review.Date, y = numRatings)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

The number of ratings gradually increases with a peak in 2015 and then a decrease in 2016 and 2017.
